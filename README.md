AI Sales Forecasting Dashboard
Task 1 — Data Import & Visualization (Actual vs Forecast)

This repository contains the first task of my internship project, where I built the initial components of an AI-powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard using Jupyter Notebook and Facebook Prophet.

✅ Task 1 Overview — Actual vs Forecast Line Chart
1. Imported the dataset

Loaded the time-series dataset containing:

ds → Date

y → Actual sales

yhat → Forecasted sales (generated by Prophet)

2. Created the line chart visualization

Using the Visualization panel in Jupyter Notebook:

Dragged:

X-axis → ds

Y-axis → y (Actual sales)

Y-axis → yhat (Forecast)

The result is a dual-line chart:

Blue line → Actual Sales

Red line → Forecasted Sales

This visualization helps in quickly comparing real vs predicted performance and serves as the foundation for building more analytical dashboards.
